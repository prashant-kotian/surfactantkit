"""Grade an extracted model answer against a question's gold answer.

Handles the three gold-answer shapes the question bank uses:
  * scalar numeric  (tolerance {"rel": x} or {"abs": x})
  * dict of named quantities, some numeric, some string classifications
    (tolerance {"<key>_rel": x, "<key>_abs": x, ...} or a blanket {"rel": x})
  * a no-solution / category string (grading_method == "category_match")

Grading is intentionally strict on the numbers (that is the whole point of the
benchmark) but tolerant on formatting: model keys are matched to gold keys by a
normalised form, so "beta" vs "Beta" vs "beta_value" still line up.
