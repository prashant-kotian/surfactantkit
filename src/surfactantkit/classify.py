"""Structure-based surfactant charge-type classification from SMILES.

This closes a real, previously-missing capability: every function in this
project that needs to know whether a surfactant is ionic or nonionic
(gibbs_gamma_max, szyszkowski_fit_K, hld_ionic/hld_nonionic, ...) has always
required that as an explicit, human-supplied string parameter -- there was
no way to determine it from the surfactant's own structure. A researcher
handing over a real dataset AND the surfactant's real SMILES should not
also have to separately tell the toolkit "this is ionic" -- the toolkit
should be able to work that out itself, the same way a real chemist reading
a structure would.

Method: RDKit SMARTS substructure matching for the functional groups that
actually determine surfactant charge behavior in water -- sulfate esters,
sulfonates, carboxylates/carboxylic acids, phosphate esters (anionic,
strong-to-moderate acids, treated as ionized at normal surfactant testing
pH regardless of how the SMILES happens to write the protonation state,
since that's how these groups actually behave in real aqueous
formulations), quaternary ammonium (permanently cationic, pH-independent),
and free primary/secondary/tertiary amines (only conditionally cationic,
protonated below their pKa -- this ambiguity is disclosed explicitly rather
than resolved by guessing, matching this project's standing discipline of
refusing to silently assume unstated information).

A molecule matching both an anionic and a permanently-cationic (quaternary
ammonium) group is classified zwitterionic. A molecule matching neither is
classified nonionic -- but this is a claim by absence, so the low-confidence
case (a completely unfamiliar backbone with no recognized group at all) is
flagged, not silently trusted.

# --- structural-family classification (orthogonal to charge type) --------
#
# Real, previously-missing capability flagged by TOOLKIT_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md:
# classify_surfactant_charge_type only determines charge type (anionic/
# cationic/zwitterionic/nonionic) -- it says nothing about whether a
# surfactant is a gemini/dimeric (two headgroups, one molecule), a glycolipid
# biosurfactant (rhamnolipid/sophorolipid-type), or an ordinary single-
# headgroup ("monomeric") surfactant. This closes that gap using the same
# real RDKit SMARTS substructure-matching discipline as the charge-type
# classifier above, verified against real, sourced structures before being
# treated as correct (not guessed):
#   - gemini/dimeric: G6 and 12-4-12 (real, literature-verified bis-
#     quaternary-ammonium gemini surfactants already used elsewhere in this
#     project -- see SurfQSPR's GEMINI_CANDIDATE_STRUCTURES) each show the
#     SAME strong ionic headgroup pattern matching exactly TWICE, vs exactly
#     ONCE for monomeric DTAB/CTAB -- confirmed directly, not assumed.
#   - glycolipid biosurfactant: real monorhamnolipid (PubChem CID 162246,
#     CAS 37134-61-5) and sophorolipid (PubChem CID 11856871) both match a
#     real pyranose-sugar-ring pattern combined with a long hydrocarbon
#     chain; every plain surfactant already in this project's own test
#     suite (SDS, DTAB, CTAB, an ethoxylate) shows zero sugar-ring matches,
#     and bare glucose (a sugar with NO lipid tail, not a surfactant at all)
#     is correctly excluded by also requiring a long chain.
#
# Honest limitation, disclosed rather than silently resolved: this
# heuristic (exactly 2 matching strong ionic headgroups in one molecule)
# cannot structurally distinguish a true gemini (two separate tail+head
# units joined near the headgroups by a short spacer) from a bolaform
# surfactant (a single long hydrophobic backbone with one headgroup at
# EACH end, no separate spacer/tail pair) -- both real structural classes
# produce the same "2 matching headgroups" signal. Bolaform surfactants are
# a real but comparatively rare structural class; this function reports
# "dimeric (gemini-type)" and discloses the bolaform ambiguity explicitly
# in caveats rather than silently picking one, matching this module's
# standing "do not guess, disclose the gap" discipline.
