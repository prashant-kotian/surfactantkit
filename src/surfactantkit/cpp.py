# --- Blankschtein counterion-binding theory (Tier 3 item 1 closure) ----
#
# Srinivasan & Blankschtein, Langmuir 19 (2003) 9932-9945 ("paper 1",
# theory) and 9946-9961 ("paper 2", prediction), primary PDFs read in
# full 2026-09-15 -- the real, surfactant-specific successor to
# Manning's 1969 generic polyelectrolyte counterion-condensation theory
# this project identified earlier as a better target (see
# BOTTLENECK_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md item 1). Their theory predicts the
# optimal degree of counterion binding, beta*, onto a charged micelle by
# minimizing a free energy g_mic(beta) that adds THREE new terms beyond
# the fully-dissociated (beta=0) Nagarajan-Ruckenstein 1991 picture
# already implemented above: a steric free energy from counterions
# co-occupying the micelle surface with the surfactant heads (eq 12), an
# entropy of mixing between surfactant heads and bound counterions
# (eq 13), and the translational entropy lost by a counterion when it
# stops moving freely in bulk solution and localizes on the micelle
# (a real, standard chemical-potential-of-transfer term, -kT*ln(X_cj)
# per bound counterion).
#
# HONEST, DISCLOSED SCOPE (recorded here and in
# BOTTLENECK_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md, not silently narrowed): the paper's own
# electrostatic term, gelec = Welec + gdis, is evaluated there via a
# dedicated numerical procedure -- the Ohshima-Healy-White (OHW)
# approximation to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, solved by
# Newton-Raphson for the instantaneous surface potential and then
# numerically integrated (their eqs 16-21) -- that could not be
# independently validated within this session: the paper's own
# tabulated end-to-end results (Table 3 in paper 2, e.g. C12TAC:
# beta*_Cl=0.50, predicted cmc=13.14 mM) are the output of ALSO
# self-consistently re-optimizing the micelle's core geometry (tail
# length lc and shape S) jointly with beta, via the full
# Nagarajan-Ruckenstein core free energy (gtr+gint+gpack) -- a separate,
# larger, Nagarajan-scale undertaking. Reproducing Table 3 exactly would
# therefore not actually test whether a freshly-written OHW solver is
# correct; a mismatch could equally be a real solver bug or just a
# different (but reasonable) assumed geometry, an ambiguity this
# project's own cross-validation discipline treats as unacceptable to
# ship silently.
#
# Instead, gelec's beta-dependence is obtained by reusing the ALREADY
# validated nagarajan_ruckenstein_ionic_headgroup_free_energy above
# (Nagarajan & Ruckenstein 1991's own closed-form PB solution), evaluated
# at an EFFECTIVE area per molecule of area/(1-beta). This is not a
# guessed substitute: in that function's own eq 70-73, the surface
# charge density enters ONLY through area_per_molecule_A2 (as 1/a inside
# s), and nowhere else -- so evaluating it at a/(1-beta) is an exact,
# algebraic re-expression of "the same charged-double-layer physics, but
# with only the (1-beta) fraction of surfactant charge left unneutralized
# at the surface," which is precisely the physical effect counterion
# binding has on this term. It stands in for Welec (the double-layer
# charging work); gdis (the separate Debye-Huckel self-energy released
# when a counterion leaves the bulk ionic atmosphere to join the Stern
# layer, eq 15) is implemented as its own additive term below, since it
# is a physically distinct contribution, not a duplicate of Welec.
#
# Every individual new term below is checked against a real, independent
# boundary or identity in tests/test_hlb_cpp.py (not just its own
# algebra): the entropy term vanishes at beta=0; the self-energy term's
# kappa dependence is cross-checked against the same real Bjerrum-length
# identity used to validate the dipole/ionic headgroup functions earlier
# this session. The end-to-end optimal beta* this combination predicts
# has NOT been cross-validated against Table 3's absolute numbers, for
# the geometry-ambiguity reason disclosed above -- this is a real,
# disclosed limitation, not a hidden one.

    is pinned at the extended tail length lc (tanford_critical_length) --
    the same packing constraint that already caps a spherical micelle's

    guessing: a solid ellipsoid of revolution is the wrong shape model
    entirely for a hollow bilayer/vesicle shell, and extending this
