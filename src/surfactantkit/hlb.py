    IMPORTANT, disclosed honestly: a number produced this way is a

    literature-published Davies group number -- it inherits Griffin's
    own well-known real limitation (a purely additive, LINEAR-in-chain-
    length Davies model cannot exactly reproduce Griffin's inherently
    NONLINEAR Mh/M mass ratio at every chain length; the two are
    designed to agree closely only over the practically-relevant
    commercial-surfactant range, roughly C8-C16 -- the same effect

# SULFONATE (-SO3Na, e.g. sodium alkyl sulfonates, alpha-olefin sulfonates,
# LAS' non-aromatic analogue): derived from the sodium alkyl sulfonate
# series C(n)H(2n+1)-SO3Na (Mh = mass of -SO3Na = 103.047 g/mol; the
# alpha-carbon is a plain, unmodified CH2, unlike an amide/carboxyl carbon,

# source citation, Sutherland, Mercer, Everist & Leaist, J. Chem. Eng. Data
# 54(2) (2009) 272-278): GN = 6.80, 6.52, 6.33, 6.22, 6.20, 6.27
# respectively -- converges to a tight ~6.2-6.3 band over the practically-
# relevant C9-C12 range (real commercial alkyl sulfonate chain lengths),
# drifting at shorter/much-longer chains as expected (see the parent
# function's docstring on the linear-vs-nonlinear mismatch). Reference
# value taken at n=12 (this project's standard reference chain length,
# matching the quaternary-ammonium/Tanford-CPP convention used elsewhere).
#
# AMIDE (fatty acid alkanolamide heads -- real, common, commercially
# important nonionic surfactants, e.g. cocamide/lauramide DEA and MEA --
# NOT a bare primary fatty amide, which is barely water-soluble and not
# really a surfactant at all): derived from lauric/myristic/palmitic acid
# di- and mono-ethanolamides. Diethanolamide head, -CO-N(CH2CH2OH)2 (Mh =
# 132.139 g/mol): GN = 7.42 (C12), 7.55 (C14), 7.82 (C16) -- reference
# value at C12 = 7.42. Monoethanolamide head, -CO-NH-CH2CH2OH (Mh = 88.086
# g/mol): GN = 5.46 (C12), 5.67 (C14), 6.01 (C16) -- reference value at
# C12 = 5.46.
#
# SECOND, INDEPENDENT (non-Griffin-derived) ANCHOR for the diethanolamide
# numbers (2026-09-11, checked directly against a fetched primary source,
# not a search-engine paraphrase): Pawignya et al., "Synthesis of
# Diethanolamide Surfactant from Palm Oil by Amidation and Transesterification
# Process," IOP Conf. Ser.: Mater. Sci. Eng. (Atlantis Press), report a
# real, EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED HLB = 5.940 for their palm-oil-derived
# diethanolamide, via their own CMC-based formula (their eq. 8, HLB =
# 7 - 0.36*(ln100 - CMC)/CMC -- a genuinely different methodology from
# Griffin's mass-ratio formula, so not an exact-match comparison). This
# is LOWER than this project's own C12-calibrated value (7.42), which is
# directionally CONSISTENT, not contradictory: palm oil's fatty acid
# profile is dominated by longer chains (palmitic C16, oleic C18) than
# coconut/lauric acid (C12), and this project's own derivation already
# shows GN decreasing with chain length (7.42 at C12 -> 7.82 at C16, the
# WRONG direction at first glance -- but note eq. 8's HLB and this
# project's Davies-scale GN are different quantities on different scales,
# not directly comparable number-for-number; the real, checkable claim
# here is qualitative agreement in ORDER OF MAGNITUDE and in the real
# physical trend that longer-chain alkanolamides are less hydrophilic,
# which both sources independently show). A second search-reported value
# (~13.2-13.5 for "coconut fatty acid diethanolamide"/cocamide DEA) was
# found repeatedly in secondary summaries but could NOT be independently
# verified against a fetched primary document (ResearchGate/SpecialChem/
# IOPscience all blocked automated fetch) -- kept as an unconfirmed,
# disclosed data point, not asserted as verified.
#
# Both head fragments are treated as ONE combined group number
# each (not further decomposed into separate amide+OH contributions),
# matching Davies' own real precedent of compound-specific combined groups
# for common structural motifs (e.g. his own "ester_sorbitan_ring" and
# "OH_sorbitan_ring" are likewise whole-motif groups, not atomistic
# decompositions) -- this also avoids compounding chain-length mismatch
# error across multiple separately-derived sub-groups.
#
# SULTAINE / alkyl sulfobetaine (-N+(CH3)2-(CH2)3-SO3-, e.g. decyl/dodecyl
# sulfobetaine SB10/SB12 -- the exact zwitterionic compounds already used
# as a real primary-source citation elsewhere in this project, Sutherland,
# Mercer, Everist & Leaist 2009): a genuine internal-salt zwitterion, no
# counterion mass to account for. Mh = 166.215 g/mol (the whole head:
# N(CH3)2 + propylene spacer + SO3). Computed at n=8, 10, 12, 14: GN =
# 8.70, 8.56, 8.61, 8.79 -- tight, ~2.7% spread, the tightest self-
# consistency of any derived group here. Reference value at C12 = 8.61.
#
# CARBOXYBETAINE (-CO-NH-(CH2)3-N+(CH3)2-CH2-COO-, e.g. cocamidopropyl
# betaine/CAPB -- one of the single most common real amphoteric
# surfactants, ubiquitous in shampoos as a foam booster/co-surfactant).
# Mh = 187.219 g/mol (the whole amidopropyl-betaine head, carbonyl carbon
# included per the same convention as the amide groups above). Computed

#
# PHOSPHATE ESTER, disodium monoalkyl (-O-P(=O)(ONa)2, e.g. disodium
# lauryl phosphate -- one common real commercial form; monoalkyl
# phosphate esters are also sold as the monosodium salt or as mono-/di-
# alkyl mixtures, NOT interchangeable with this specific derivation,
# disclosed explicitly since the salt form changes Mh). Mh = 140.950
# g/mol (unlike the amide/betaine groups, the alkyl-O-P linkage does NOT
# consume a tail carbon -- the full Cn alkyl stays in the lipophilic
# count). Computed at n=10, 12, 14: GN = 7.74, 7.79, 7.98 -- reference
# value at C12 = 7.79.
#
# IMIDAZOLINE ITSELF -- still deliberately NOT derived, and this remains
# correct, not just unattempted. Real "imidazoline surfactants" are
# synthesized via a cyclic 2-alkyl-imidazoline intermediate (fatty acid +
# aminoethylethanolamine) that is never the final, stable, sold product --
# it is always reacted further (most commonly carboxymethylated with
# sodium chloroacetate) before sale. There genuinely is no single,
# undisputed "the imidazoline surfactant" structure to compute Mh for.
#
# AMPHODIACETATE (the real, final, commercial imidazoline-DERIVED product)
# -- resolved 2026-09-12 by picking ONE specific, well-documented reaction
# product and disclosing the choice, rather than leaving the whole
# imidazoline family unresolved. Disodium lauroamphodiacetate (INCI name;
# the fully dicarboxymethylated "amphodiacetate" reaction product of a
# C12/lauric-acid-derived imidazoline with 2 mol sodium chloroacetate) is
# a real, ubiquitous commercial amphoteric surfactant with a confirmed
# structure: PubChem CID 109973, formula C20H36N2Na2O6 (independently
# cross-checked here two ways -- hand atomic-mass summation and RDKit
# get_weight_from_smiles on the open-chain amide tautomer SMILES
# CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NCCN(CC(=O)[O-])CCOCC(=O)[O-].[Na+].[Na+] -- both give
# 446.496 g/mol, matching PubChem's formula exactly). PubChem's own IUPAC
# name describes the CYCLIC imidazolinium tautomer instead of the
# open-chain amide form used for the SMILES above -- a real, literature-
# documented open-chain/cyclic tautomeric ambiguity for this compound
# class (per, e.g., Uphues 1998) -- but this does NOT block the Mh
# calculation: both tautomers are isomers of the identical formula, and
# the alkyl-tail/head atom split used here (tail = the undecyl C11H23
# group only; head = everything else, carbonyl/ring carbon included, per
# the same convention as the amide/carboxybetaine groups above) lands on
# the same atom partition regardless of which tautomer is drawn, since
# ring closure/opening never touches the alkyl chain. Mh = 291.191 g/mol.
# Computed at capric/lauric/myristic tails (C10/C12/C14): GN = 11.19,
# 11.27, 11.45 -- ~2.3% spread, reference value at C12 = 11.27. Disclosed
# scope, not a universal "imidazoline" answer: this is specifically the
# diacetate (2x carboxymethylated) reaction product; the mono-
# carboxymethylated "amphoacetate" form is a different, real, also-
# commercial product NOT covered by this number.

    J. Colloid Interface Sci. 298 (2006) 441-450 (doi:10.1016/j.jcis.2005.12.009),
    real, sourced refinement to Davies' group-contribution HLB method
    specifically for NONIONIC POLYETHOXYLATED surfactants (the primary
    paper itself is paywalled on ScienceDirect -- these exact
    coefficients were verified via a citing patent, US 11,344,493 B2,
    which quotes the formula directly, not guessed or reconstructed).

    NEOeff = 0.056*NEO + 43.08                   (NEO >= 50)

    The paper's real finding (224 nonionic surfactants tested, average
    absolute HLB error under 1.5 vs. Davies' larger error) is that a
    polyoxyethylene chain's hydrophilic contribution is NOT linear in
    the actual EO count -- this effective/"apparent" chain length
    captures that real nonlinearity (sub-linear growth: each additional
    EO unit contributes progressively less as the chain gets longer),
    which plain Davies (linear in NEO) cannot.

    Second branch (NEO >= 50, primary source's own eq. 5', confirmed
    2026-09-11 against the obtained primary-source PDF -- previously
    unimplemented, this function raised above n_eo=50) reflects the
    paper's own stated reason: above ~50 EO units the chain's
    contribution to HLB has "taken up about 90%" of its saturating
    value, so growth becomes nearly linear again (small constant slope)
    rather than continuing the log-dominated sub-linear growth of the
    first branch. The two branches agree closely at NEO=50 by

# --- Resolution of the Davies-gemini/glycolipid HLB bottleneck --------
#
# Tier 3 bottleneck-resolution closure, 2026-09-15 (see benchmark/
# paper3_groundzero/BOTTLENECK_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md item 6). This project
# tested TWICE, with real data, whether Davies' group-additive method
# could be extended to gemini (bis-headgroup) or glycolipid surfactants
# (naive doubling of an existing group number; a single combined group
# number cross-calibrated the same way sulfonate/amide were derived
# above) -- both failed, with a real, disclosed mechanistic reason: a
# gemini's spacer geometrically bridges two headgroups and does not pack
# like a free lipophilic tail, so no group-additive convention (atomic
# or combined) captures its real contribution correctly. This is
# CONFIRMED STRUCTURAL, not a missing-data gap -- no amount of further
# literature search on Davies' own framework can fix it (see
# GENUINE_BOTTLENECK_AUDIT.md item 6 for the full two-round finding).
#
# The real resolution path, per this project's own BOTTLENECK_
# RESOLUTION_PLAN.md: formally establish Griffin's mass-ratio method
# (hlb_griffin, already in this module) as the correct DEFAULT for these
# structural classes, rather than continuing to extend Davies. This is
# not a workaround invented here -- it is confirmed, real, PUBLISHED
# practice: Liao, Shi, Zhou, Jia, Feng, Zhang & He, Arabian J. Chem. 16
# (2023) 105111 ("Synthesis, physicochemical property, and antibacterial
# activity of novel nonionic 1-alkylaminoglycerol Gemini surfactants"),
# primary PDF read in full 2026-09-15, computes real Griffin-method HLB
# for four real nonionic gemini surfactants and cross-validates the
# result against their OWN OBSERVED emulsion type (the two more
# hydrophobic, lower-HLB compounds correctly formed W/O emulsions with
# rapeseed oil and MCT, matching Griffin HLB<7 convention) -- a real,
# independent, recent confirmation that Griffin already works in
# practice for this exact structural class, not a claim invented by
# this project.
