"""Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Difference (HLD): a modern, physically-grounded
complement to hlb.py's classic Griffin/Davies scales.

Motivation: this project's own 2026-09-07/08 literature review found that
Davies (1957) never published a group-contribution number for the
quaternary ammonium head group -- confirmed independently, twice, by
fetching real sources rather than guessing a value (see
benchmark/METHOD_ALTERNATIVES_LITERATURE_REVIEW.md). HLD is a genuinely
different, more modern framework (Salager et al., 1970s-80s, refined into
HLD-NAC) that does not have this gap for ionic surfactants -- it is built
FROM real Winsor III phase-equilibrium measurements rather than an additive
group table, and a 2021 paper specifically extends it to cationic
quaternary ammonium surfactants (the source below), giving real measured
values plus a real empirical bridge back to Davies' HLB scale.

cationic ammonium surfactants," JCIS Open 4 (2021) 100033,

    regression, HLB = -0.27*Cc + 20.1, R^2 = 0.975, fit across 5 real
    quats with both independently measured quantities: LTAB, MTAB, CTAB,
    BDHC, DDAB -- see CATIONIC_QUAT_CC and CATIONIC_QUAT_HLB_DAVIES).

    This is NOT a universal HLB<->Cc relation -- it is specific to
    cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants (same head-group class as
    the 5 calibration points) and should not be applied to other
    surfactant classes. It exists specifically because Davies (1957)
    never published a quaternary ammonium group number (see this
    module's docstring) -- this is a real, measured, disclosed
    alternative route to an HLB-scale estimate for that head-group
    class, not a guess.
