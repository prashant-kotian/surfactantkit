    out of its own scope.

    REWRITTEN 2026-09-11 (SI obtained, docx+CSVs provided by the user;
    replaces an earlier 2026-09-10 first-principles least-squares
    construction entirely, per this project's own Upgrade Protocol --
    the old method is not kept alongside this one). The real history,
    disclosed honestly because it matters for trusting this function:

    1. The SI's own GAMS code gives the real objective as MINIMIZING
       TOTAL FREE ENERGY OF MICELLIZATION, subject to the r-generalized
       mass-balance constraints (cdefp1/cdefp2) with CMCexpVar bounded
       (not pinned) to +/-10% of each mixture's experimental CMC. A
       first attempt to transcribe that free-energy objective exactly
       found it is UNBOUNDED BELOW as literally written (the Margules
       mixing term diverges as |W12|,|W21| grow, so minimizing it always
       ran to whatever W12/W21 search box was set -- confirmed on both
       synthetic and real Hyamine/DTAB data). That attempt was abandoned
       rather than shipped broken.
    2. A companion paper's SI (Serafini et al. 2019, TX100-DTAB, also
       obtained 2026-09-11) explains the REAL procedure in prose: "the mg
       [margin] parameter was varied in order to obtain the minimum
       value that allowed a feasible solution" -- i.e. the real fitting
       criterion is CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION at the tightest margin that
       remains feasible, not open-ended free-energy minimization under a
       fixed generous margin. This function implements THAT procedure:
       minimize a total INFEASIBILITY measure (see
       _eommm_point_infeasibility) at the given cmc_margin, rather than
       free energy -- a well-posed, bounded objective, unlike (1).
    3. A real, disclosed THEORETICAL property of this model (matching the
       Serafini SI's own stated reason for the margin-tightening
       procedure), tested carefully rather than assumed: a wider
       cmc_margin admits more of the (W12, W21) plane as feasible, so
       uniqueness is not GUARANTEED at a generous margin for every
       dataset -- multiple different (W12, W21) pairs could in principle
       both achieve zero infeasibility. An early attempt to demonstrate
       this concretely on the synthetic round-trip dataset below
       (constructed from TRUE W12=6.0, W21=-3.0) turned out to be an
       artifact of insufficient grid resolution in a first prototype,
       NOT a real property of that specific case -- with adequate
       resolution (this function's actual shipped defaults), that
       dataset recovers the exact true (W12, W21) at BOTH a tight
       cmc_margin (1e-6) and the SI's own default (0.10). This distinction
       (a real theoretical concern vs. a disproven concrete example) is
       kept explicit rather than either overclaiming non-uniqueness or
       quietly dropping the concern -- see tests/test_mixed_micelle.py
       for both the exact-recovery tests and this history. This function
       does NOT automatically search for the tightest feasible
       cmc_margin (an automatic search was prototyped and found to have
       a real, unresolved grid-resolution sensitivity that makes it
       converge to a margin somewhat looser than the true minimum -- a
       genuine remaining limitation, not silently hidden): call this
       function at a few DECREASING cmc_margin values yourself and watch
       total_infeasibility and (W12, W21) for where they stabilize, the
       same diagnostic the SI's own procedure is doing manually.

    Solved via a 2-level (coarse then fine) grid search over (W12, W21)
    -- see _two_level_grid_search_2d's own docstring for why coordinate
    descent / golden-section refinement was tried and found to actively
    walk AWAY from the true optimum (a real, disclosed finding, not a
    minor implementation detail).

    r1, r2: dissociation numbers for components 1 and 2 (how many
    particles each nominally dissociates into in the micellar pseudo-
    phase) -- default 2.0 for both, the classical fully-dissociated 1:1
    ionic convention already used throughout this module (solve_rubingh_x,
    clint_ideal_cmc, etc.); pass 1.0 for a nonionic component. cmc_margin:
    the fraction (0 to 1) each mixture's implied CMC is allowed to float
    from its experimental value -- default 0.10 matches the SI's own
    stated default. w_bound: symmetric search range for W12/W21 in RT
    units (default +/-30, generous relative to real reported values like
    the Serafini et al. TX100-DTAB system's own W12=+4.04, W21=-14.02).

    Needs at least 3 composition points. Runtime is a few seconds (a
    genuine 2D grid search with no numpy/scipy dependency, consistent
    with this project's existing EOMMM runtime expectations) -- expect
    that, it is not an error.
