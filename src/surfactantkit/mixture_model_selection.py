"""Model-selection orchestrator for binary surfactant mixtures: given a raw
(alpha1, cmc_mix) composition series plus the two pure-component CMCs, decide
which of the competing mixture theories in mixed_micelle.py actually fits this
system, rather than requiring the caller to already know which one to use.

This is the mixture-side analogue of adsorption.py's select_isotherm_model
(Langmuir vs. Frumkin via BIC) -- same idea (real competing-model fit +
information-criterion comparison, not a coin flip), applied to the mixture-
CMC-model family, and the same real gap this project's own
TOOLKIT_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md flagged: mixed_micelle.py already has 9 real,
tested competing theories, but nothing ran them together and concluded which
one fits until this module.

Not every one of the 9 theories in mixed_micelle.py is a competing PARAMETRIC
predictor of cmc_mix(alpha1) from the same raw input, so not every one enters
the model-selection race here -- each exclusion is a real, structural reason,
disclosed explicitly rather than silently omitted:

  - Rosen's monolayer extension needs surface-tension-derived concentrations
    (c1_sigma/c2_sigma/c_mix_sigma at a reference tension), not CMC data --
    a genuinely different experimental input, not obtainable from a bare
    (alpha1_series, cmc_mix_series, cmc1, cmc2) call.
  - Corrin-Harkins needs a counterion-concentration series (a salt-addition
    experiment), not a composition series -- different experiment entirely.
  - Maeda's free energy of micellization is not an independent cmc_mix
    predictor at all -- it reuses Rubingh's own already-solved x1/beta as an
    input and returns a thermodynamic quantity (deltaG), not a competing
    cmc_mix(alpha1) curve. It doesn't compete with Rubingh, it extends it.
  - Rodenas' method is real and included, but not folded into the SAME BIC
    race as Clint/Rubingh/EOMMM: it is a model-INDEPENDENT decomposition of
    the given curve (a numerical derivative), not a parametric model that
    predicts cmc_mix from a fitted parameter -- there is no over/underfitting
    number of parameters to penalize, and no "residual against the data" in
    the same sense (it always exactly reproduces whatever local slope the
    data has). Reported alongside the BIC race as an independent cross-check,
    not a competing entry in it.

What actually competes, on a common footing (predicted cmc_mix(alpha1) vs.
actual, in ln-space, BIC-penalized by real parameter count):
  - Clint ideal mixing (0 parameters -- the null/no-interaction hypothesis)
  - Rubingh regular-solution theory, regressed beta (1 parameter)
  - EOMMM asymmetric Margules global fit (2 parameters, W12/W21)

    missing forward direction this module needed and mixed_micelle.py did
    not have: solve_rubingh_x/rubingh_beta only go from a MEASURED cmc_mix
    to the implied (x1, beta), never the other way.

    Derivation (real, from mixed_micelle.py's own already-verified formulas,
    not a new assumption): at the true root x1 of the original Rubingh
    residual, both components' own mass-balance relations give the SAME
    cmc_mix:
        cmc_mix = x1 * cmc1 * f1(x1, beta) / alpha1                  (A)
        cmc_mix = (1 - x1) * cmc2 * f2(x1, beta) / (1 - alpha1)       (B)
    (f1, f2 from activity_coefficients -- see rubingh_beta's own definition,
    beta = term1/(1-x1)^2, term1 = log((alpha1*cmc_mix)/(x1*cmc1)), which is
    exactly (A) rearranged; (B) follows symmetrically from the residual's own
    x1^2*term1 = (1-x1)^2*term2 identity at the root). Given beta (rather
    than cmc_mix) as the known quantity, this leaves ONE equation in the one
    unknown x1: where (A) and (B) agree. Solved by the same grid-scan +
    bisection root-finding pattern already used throughout this module
    (solve_rubingh_x), just with the roles of cmc_mix and beta swapped.

    Verified against two independent existing formulas, not just the
    derivation above (see tests/test_mixture_model_selection.py):
      - at beta=0 (no interaction), the solved x1 reduces EXACTLY to
        motomura_ideal_composition's own zero-interaction formula, and the
        predicted cmc_mix reduces EXACTLY to clint_ideal_cmc -- both are the
        same zero-parameter null hypothesis approached two different ways,
        and they must agree.
      - round-trip: predicting cmc_mix at a given (alpha1, beta) and then
        re-solving beta from that predicted cmc_mix via the EXISTING
        solve_rubingh_x/rubingh_beta recovers the original beta.

    Returns None if no root is found in (0, 1) -- mirrors solve_rubingh_x's
    own contract for the same underlying reason (e.g. a beta/alpha1
    combination with no physically consistent composition).
