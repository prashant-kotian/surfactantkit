"""Micellar solubilization capacity.

Originally implemented only the Molar Solubilization Ratio (MSR), which
has one clean, unambiguous definition in the literature -- the
micelle-water partition coefficient (Km) was deliberately left out,
because a check of the literature found its exact formula is study-
specific (some define it on a mole fraction basis, others on a molar-
concentration-ratio basis, with no single dominant convention), and
implementing one silently risked reproducing the wrong convention for a
given paper.

UPDATE, 2026-09-10 (alternative-methods sweep): re-checked, and the
ambiguity is real and still unresolved -- but Km is also a real,
commonly co-reported COMPLEMENTARY metric to MSR (this project's own
literature review: apparent solubilization capacity depends heavily on
WHERE the solute sits, palisade/interface vs. core -- MSR alone doesn't
capture this). Rather than continue omitting it entirely, this module
now implements the MOLE-FRACTION-BASIS convention specifically (X_mic/
X_w, one of the two real conventions found, not invented) with the
ambiguity explicitly disclosed in micelle_water_partition_coefficient's
own docstring -- letting a researcher use it with eyes open, matching
this project's "let a researcher choose the method suited to their
system" goal, rather than a blanket omission. Same discipline as the
missing Davies HLB groups and the unimplemented Krafft point for
anything that remains genuinely unresolved.

    benchmark/paper3_groundzero/BOTTLENECK_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md item 13),
    for compounds no real measured value has been sourced for yet.

    Method: ESOL (Delaney, J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 1000-1005)
    -- a real, published, widely-used linear QSPR fit on 2874 measured
    aqueous solubilities:

        log10(S, mol/L) = a - b*clogP - c*MW + d*RB - e*AP

    Coefficients used here are Pat Walters' RDKit-specific REFIT of
    Delaney's original model (practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com,
    "Predicting Aqueous Solubility -- It's Harder Than It Looks", 2018;
    code: github.com/PatWalters/solubility), not Delaney's original
    published coefficients -- deliberately, because Delaney's own
    coefficients were fit against his own (Molconn-Z-derived) clogP
    values, which are NOT numerically identical to RDKit's Crippen.MolLogP
    used here; using RDKit's own descriptors with Delaney's original
    coefficients would silently mix two different logP implementations.
    Walters' refit was specifically calibrated for RDKit's own
    Descriptors.MolWt, Crippen.MolLogP, Lipinski.NumRotatableBonds, and
    an aromatic-atom-fraction proportion -- live-verified 2026-09-15
    before being hardcoded here.

    HONEST, PROMINENT LIMITATION: this is a coarse QSPR ESTIMATE, not a
    measurement -- Delaney's own validation reports roughly 0.6-1 log-
    unit RMSE (i.e. this can be off by up to an order of magnitude or
    more for an individual compound), and is real, published estimation
    error, not a defect of this implementation. Use a real measured
    value (or this project's own mined literature values) whenever one
    is available; treat this only as a fallback for compounds nothing
    else has been sourced for, always disclosed as an estimate, never
    silently substituted for a real measurement.
