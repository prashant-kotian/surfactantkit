"""Tests for surfactantkit.mixed_micelle.

Validation strategy, deliberately explicit about what's certain and what
isn't. This library was checked against ELEVEN independent published
binary surfactant systems (cationic-anionic, cationic-nonionic,
anionic-nonionic, gemini-nonionic, gemini-zwitterionic,
nonionic-biosurfactant, anionic-anionic/bile salt, zwitterionic-anionic,
zwitterionic-cationic, nonionic-cationic), all open access, numbers
pulled directly from source tables. Full case-by-case notes, including a
log of dead-end search attempts: see literature_validation_notes.md.

1. Clint ideal CMC: hard exact-match assertions against papers that
   report a directly comparable ideal-CMC value (Azum et al. 2022;
   McLachlan et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020). One paper in the survey
   (Muherei & Junin 2009) reports an "ideal" CMC that does NOT reproduce
   from its own stated pure-component CMCs via the standard Clint
   formula (0.73 mM computed vs. 0.906 mM reported) -- flagged as an
   unexplained discrepancy in that source (possibly a different pure-CMC
   basis for their ideal column), not asserted here.

2. Rubingh solver, micellar mole fraction (x1): hard assertions against
   FIVE literature systems -- matches to within ~1% in every case. This
   is the strongest evidence the solver is correct, since x1 is the
   solver's actual output (beta is then a deterministic function of it).

3. Rubingh solver, interaction parameter (beta): NOT asserted against
   literature values directly. Investigation across all five systems
   found the two algebraically-equivalent ways of computing beta at the
   solved root (term1/(1-x1)^2 and term2/x1^2) agree with each other to
   3-4 decimal places every time (confirming internal correctness), but
   neither matches the literature-reported beta precisely (typically
   off by 5-20%, sign always correct). The most likely explanation:
   many papers fit beta by regression across several alpha compositions,
   while this solver computes the exact pointwise value for one
   composition -- both are legitimate, but not directly comparable to
   3 decimals. We assert sign and same order of magnitude only.

4. The Rubingh solver is ALSO checked with mathematically guaranteed
   round-trip tests (construct a cmc_mix for which a chosen x1 is the
   exact algebraic root, solve it back, recover the same x1 and beta) --
   these don't depend on trusting any external source at all.

    differentiates THAT analytically. A smooth global fit and a local
    quadratic through 3 sparse, unevenly-spaced neighbors are genuinely
    different numerical procedures and are not expected to agree
    closely on data this sparse. The paper's own text also states it
    excluded the alpha1=0.025 point from its own Figure 4 as unreliable
    -- an explicit admission that this point is not trustworthy even by
    the source's own standard. Note this is NOT the single worst point
    here by our own error metric (alpha1=0.1 is, at 60% relative error
    vs. alpha1=0.025's 54%) -- but both of the two lowest-alpha1 points,
    where the paper admits unreliability, are the two worst overall,
    which is the honest, checkable claim actually asserted below.

    Kept as a real, honest record (like the Azum-paper check above) --
    this is evidence rodenas_x1_series's sparse-series numerical
    differentiation has genuine, real limits on very sparse/uneven data,
    not evidence the core rodenas_x1 formula itself is wrong (that
    formula is separately verified via the exact zero-interaction
    algebraic identity in test_rodenas_x1_reduces_to_motomura_under_ideal_mixing,
    which does not depend on any finite-difference approximation)."""
