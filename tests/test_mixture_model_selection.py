"""Tests for surfactantkit.mixture_model_selection.

Same validation strategy already established elsewhere in this project for
purely-numerical solvers with no single external literature source to check
against directly (see test_mixed_micelle.py's own rubingh_beta_regression/
eommm_global_fit tests): mathematically-guaranteed round trips (construct a
series for a KNOWN true parameter, recover it) plus real reduction checks
(a general model must reduce EXACTLY to its own zero-interaction special
case). DTAB/SDS pure CMCs match the same real system already used throughout
test_mixed_micelle.py and Category B of the Paper 3 benchmark.
