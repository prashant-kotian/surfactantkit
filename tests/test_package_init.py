"""Tests for surfactantkit's own top-level __init__.py export surface.

Added 2026-09-15 after a real gap was found during a Tier 1 bottleneck-
resolution completeness audit: __init__.py had not been updated since
before classify.py existed, so a direct `from surfactantkit import X`
user could not reach classify_surfactant_charge_type,
classify_surfactant_structural_family, or any of the 5 new functions
built this session -- despite all of them being real, tested, and
wired into the MCP server. A first manual pass fixed the functions this
session had touched; a second, PROGRAMMATIC pass (AST-walking every
module file for public top-level functions and diffing against
__all__) caught two more real, pre-existing gaps the manual pass missed
entirely (adsorption.py's frumkin_fit_K_and_a and select_isotherm_model,
both real, tested, MCP-wired capabilities from 2026-09-13). That
programmatic check is now test_no_public_function_is_missing_from_dunder_all
below, permanently, per this project's own "close a workflow to its
entirety, and guard against it recurring" standing rule (see
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) -- a future new public function added to any module
and never added to __all__ now fails loudly instead of silently.
